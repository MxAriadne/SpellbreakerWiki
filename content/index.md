# Welcome to the Spellbreaker Repair Wiki!

If you've stumbled across this website I've either sent you a direct link to it or you have weird search terms because the SEO is not even close to setup.

This is a repository of repair knowledge for anything we come across, including: phones, consoles, computer parts, etc.

While you're here, consider checking out the [[Resources]] tab for sites we recommend for more info.
There's also a short [[How-To Guides]] section for more explicit tutorials rather than the simple diagnostic steps listed on other pages.
