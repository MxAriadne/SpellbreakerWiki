| Not connecting                       | Pulling 3.4+A                | Likely defective ribbon cable, or if this cable is new you may have bought the wrong one as there are 3 different revisions of this cable.                                                                                                                                                                               | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/DualShock_4)     |
| Not charging                         |                              | Likely PMIC is bad on the charging board, it's replaceable but it may be cheaper to buy a new board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/DualShock_4)     |
| Stick Drift                          |                              | - There are two "pots" on either side of the joysticks that should be cleaned first as they can be the cause.<br><br>- If cleaning does not work, the joystick will need replaced. There are two types of sticks available, green and orange. You can only swap green for green and orange for orange due to shaft size. | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/DualShock_4)<br> |
| Various buttons randomly triggering. |                              | - Clean the contacts on the film under the buttons<br><br>- If cleaning does not work, check the traces near the pads on the film, the lower traces are prone to failure.                                                                                                                                                | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/DualShock_4)<br> |
