If it starts working after this then you will need to reball the APU.<br><br>- If the above solutions don't work, the culprit is likely one of the RAM ICs. They are known to go bad due to excessive heat. This can be confirmed by using a thermal camera. | [Source](https://repair.wiki/w/Playstation_4_Pulsing_Blue_Light_of_Death) |
