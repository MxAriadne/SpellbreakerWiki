This may indicate the IC itself is to blame. Replacements are available and they're not married.<br><br>- Plug your bench power supply into the 12v input pins. If you have no 300ma boot sequence, remove BIOS IC for 10-20 minutes completely from the board, resolder and retry. If still no change reprogram BIOS with a working digital edition copy of the BIOS (this will remove the ability to use a BDROM on disc editions)                                                           | [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jphoO6dQ4oo)                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Shorted 1.1v rail                                                  | Pulsing between 7ma and 12ma      | Continuous pulsing      | Check for short on bottom middle inductor behind Southbridge. Possible bad Southbridge or shorted cap behind Southbridge         |
| Shorted 2v rail                                                    | 35ma                              | No Sleep                | Check for short on 2v rail (back of board, bottom inductor near middle left SBV IC)                                              |
| Shorted SOP-23 behind HDMI encoder                                 | 5ma                               | No Sleep                | Check for shorted SOP-23 IC behind MN864739 HDMI encoder. Could be a bad component or a bad HDMI encoder                         |
| Bad Southbridge most likely caused by power surge on ethernet port | 7ma                               | No Sleep                | Check for shorts on Bothand Magnetics Module (below ethernet port) for shorts. If short on any pin to ground replace Southbridge |
