If visual inspection comes up fine proceed to replace board, or check continuity on the pins for power/data from Wii to disc drive on your discretion. To replace the board, unscrew the two Philips screws holding the board to the disc drive, disconnect the disc motor cable from the board, laser cable and disc insertion sensor cable, desolder the disc insertion motor cables (red and brown), desolder laser stepper motor cables (white, blue, grey, and yellow)-- remember to document correct order when desoldering and proceed to replace in reverse order. |                                                                                                      |
