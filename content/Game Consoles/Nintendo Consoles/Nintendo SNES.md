This should be either 9V DC or AC.<br><br>- If a DC power supply is used, check the correct polarization of the barrel jack of the Power Adapter. The (Japanese) Super Famicom uses a central Ground pin with a positive (9V) outer shell while the USA and European Super Nintendo uses a central positive (9V) pin and the barrel as ground. 9V AC should also work as the device rectifies the AC internally<br><br>- Check continuity of the fuse (top left side of the board, near the power connector. The fuse is floating inside a cutout of the PCB.<br><br>- Check output of the 7805 (located on the left side, attached to the heat sink)<br><br>- Check that the input suppression choke (coil) has a low impedance.                                                                                                                                                  |        |

All pins should be identical.<br><br>- Check that the /RESET line (pin 10 on the CIC chip (U8), 34 on PPU2 (U3)) is high after turning the device on (with a cartridge in). If it is not, the CIC chip may hold the RESET line low because it cannot communicate with the cartridge properly. Try cleaning the cartridge slot or try a different cartridge.<br><br>- Check that the /RESOUT0 line (pin 33 on the PPU2 (U3)) and /RESOUT1 line (pin 28 on the PPU2 (U3)) are high after turning the device on (with a cartridge in). If they are low, while the /RESET line (see above) from the CIC chip (U8) is high), replace the PPU2 chip.<br><br>- Check activity on the PPU2. Check if signals are output through the RGB and CSYNC output pins 95, 96, 97, and 100 of the PPU2 (U3). If there is no data, replace PPU2. If there is data, replace S-ENC (U7). |        |

Check its continuity between the vias. If it is not conducting, run a bodge wire on the bottom side of the board from R70 straight to a test point that is connected to C66 (see picture). Replace C59 with a 10uF/50V non-polarized electrolytic cap. The problem is caused by a leaking cap C59 that has eaten away the trace. On old boards, they designed in the wrong cap type. C59 and its neighbor C60 are used to provide +12V on the AV connector for peripherals that use power. Some AV-to-hdmi adapters use it. Leaving out C59 will only remove the 12V power from the AV connector and should not have side-effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |        |
| RF output not working.                                                                   |                                         | - RF output should be around 55.55MHz for PAL and 91.35MHz for NTSC-J.<br><br>- Check with an oscilloscope if there is a signal on pin 7 of the S-ENC chip (U7).<br><br>- If there is not a signal, check if U7 has 5V power on pin 5, and a clock signal on pin 14. If both signals are okay, U7 may be broken. replace U7 (S-ENC).<br><br>- If U7 puts out a signal on its pin 7, check continuity between pin 7 of U7 and pin 2 of the RF module. The resistor R30 should also be connected to pin 7 on U7 and to pin 2 of the RF module. Check if C59 has leaked (see "Left audio not working" solution). Run a bodgewire from R30 to pin 2 of the RF module. R30 is at the bottom of the PCB. For the PAL version R30 is at the front side of the device, and you should use the side that is closest to the edge of the PCB. For the Japanese, R30 is at the back of the device, near the RF module's pins, and use the side that is farthest away from the edge of the PCB. It is best to check continuity to pin 7 of U7, just to be sure you have the correct side.                                                                            |        |
| RESET button not working.                                                                |                                         | Test if the reset switch properly bridges the front two pins when pushed. There are markings of 2 and 6 on top of the switch for above pins. Pushing the switch should lower the resistance to practically zero. If the contacts don't get bridged properly or if there is still resistance, spray some contact spray inside the switch from the top. If this does not help, replace the switch. Use a high powered soldering iron because the switch is connected to both the GND and the VCC plane which takes away a lot of the heat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        |
| Incorrect colors, banding on the image                                                   |                                         | If incorrect colors are shown (a tinted image, not a grayscale image. A grayscale image is most likely a different issue), and there are horizontal lines across the overall image, the S-ENC (U7) chip needs replacing. There are two major types of S-ENC (U7) chips. They are identical in functionality but the supporting circuitry is different so they are not interchangeable without changing the circuitry around them too. There is a Nintendo branded S-ENC (9xxx) that is mostly used in PAL devices and some of the older NTSC devices, and the BA6592F chip that is used in most NTSC devices. The BA6592F doesn't bare the Nintendo logo, and you might be able to find those online, sometimes even new old stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |        |
