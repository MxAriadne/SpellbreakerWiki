The check includes: Lower LCD, Lower LCD backlight, Upper LCD, Inner Camera, and the Battery. Reseating one of these cables will likely fix the issue. If it does not, one of these components is likely defective.<br><br>- Can also be caused by a shorted volume slider. On each of the short sides of the slider are two pins. One of these pins is always grounded, and the other should vary in resistance when the volume is changed. If both pins are grounded no matter where the volume is set then it is not working correctly. | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/New_Nintendo_2DS_XL)                         |
