| No power.                            |                                  | - Use a multimeter to verify 12V is coming from the PSU connector (Top row should be all 12V, bottom row should be all GND.) If not, test with a known good PSU.<br><br>- A bad HDMI encoder IC can also cause power issues.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/Xbox_Series_X)                                                                |
| Powers off after roughly 3 seconds.  |                                  | - If you just replaced the HDMI port, double check your work and make sure you don't have any pins bridged.<br><br>- Short present on 12V rail. Test for shorts around the PMICs. Try to remove surrounding chips one by one and test if the shorts are still there until you find the faulty chip.                                                                                                               | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/Xbox_Series_X)                                                                |

| No display.                          | Displays in low resolution mode. | HDMI encoder is bad, replace it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/Xbox_Series_X)                                                                |

This IC cannot be purchased so a donor will need to be pulled and reballed. Alternatively, there is a bypass board you can purchase and manually run wires for. | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/Xbox_Series_X)                                                                |
