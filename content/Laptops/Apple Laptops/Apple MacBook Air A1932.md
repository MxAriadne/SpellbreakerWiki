Click the icon, Navigate to the top menu bar click "Actions" then "Advanced". Select Revive device. You will see a progress bar appear. This process can take anywhere from 2 minutes to over 30 minutes in some cases. It is important to note, if the device is in Recovery mode, the end user may have brought the device to another repair shop or Apple first, who attempted a DFU revive which failed. You may have a secondary issue if the revive fails again.<br><br>- **SELECTING RESTORE WILL WIPE ALL USER DATA!**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [Follow the provided Apple support article for the procedure.](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/revive-or-restore-an-intel-based-mac-apdebea5be51/mac)<br><br>[Source](https://repair.wiki/w/MacBook_Air_A1932_Not_turning_on,_pulling_0.10-0.25_A_at_5V_cycling_repair) |
| No power.                           | - Pulls 5V 0.10A/0.25A<br><br>- Causes ampreader to power cycle.<br><br>- PP3v3_G3H_RTC Low or Absent<br><br>- Not stuck in DFU mode. | PP3v3_G3H_RTC powers the "brain" functionality of the CD3215 USB-C controllers which allows negotiation with the USB-C charger to allow 20 V. When PP3v3_G3H_RTC is shorted, low, or absent, this communication cannot take place, and the device will be stuck at 5 V. On the 820-01521, U6960 generates PP3v3_G3H_RTC. U6960 is a buck converter which lowers the voltage from PPBUS_G3H (≈12 V) to 3.3 V. Since PPBUS_G3H is the VIN (voltage input), we must get PPBUS_G3H before we get PP3v3_G3H_RTC.<br><br>- Diagnose possible shorted capacitor around CD3215 or from CD3215 itself.<br><br>- Check GHGR_EN_MVR signal produced by ISL9240 (U7000).<br><br>- If PP3v3_G3H_RTC is not shorted, check for its enable signal, GHGR_EN_MVR. CHGR_EN_MVR is produced by the ISL9240 (U7000). The ISL9240 commonly fails in a way that prevents CHGR_EN_MVR from being produced. If the enable signal above is missing, replace the ISL9240 (U7000.)<br><br>- PP3v3_G3H_RTC can also be pulled low by PP3v3_UPC_XA_LDO or PP3v3_UPC_XB_LDO, so if you have no measurable short to ground, and your enable/VIN is present, check both the above rails for a short or low resistance to ground. Low resistance to ground/short on the above LDO lines will usually be caused by a bad CD3215.<br><br>- Replace ISL9240 (U7000) if enable signal is missing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Source](https://repair.wiki/w/MacBook_Air_A1932_Not_turning_on,_pulling_0.10-0.25_A_at_5V_cycling_repair)                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The ISL9240 relies on a series of current sensing resistors to measure the amount of power being used by its output rail, PPBUS_G3H. If one of these resistors is blown, the chip will think that something on the output is pulling too much power, and it will disable itself as a protection measure.<br>    - Check current sensing resistors: R7021, R7022, R7061, R7062.<br>        - Their values are all 1Ohm<br>- Replace ISL9240 if the resistors are normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

The CD3215 that corresponds to the port where PPDCIN_G3H missing will usually be the cause of the fault.<br><br>- To diagnose which CD3215 is not opening the DC IN MOSFET you will need to take 2 measurements, one to determine which CD3215 is in use and another to confirm which CD3215 is not opening the DC IN MOSFET. First, measure voltage on F3000 and F3010. One will measure 0 V, and one will measure 5 V. The fuse that measures 5 V corresponds with the CD3215 in use.<br><br>- F3000 goes to U3100 and F3010 goes to U3200. Each fuse corresponds to a USB-C port.<br><br>- Check PPDCIN_G3H voltage on both ports.

If the fuse is blown, proceed to the "Backlight fuse (F8400) blown in the absence of a short to ground" repair steps below If voltage is normal on both sides of the backlight fuse, proceed to the next step.<br><br>- Check that the backlight circuit is being enabled. The screen will need to be connected for the enable signal to be sent out.<br><br>- With the board on your bench, with a known good screen connected, measure voltage on pins 1 and 2 of R8442.<br><br>- You should have ~3.3v. Low voltage (less than 3.3v but more than 0v) on pin 2 of R8442 (Figure 4) is suggestive of an issue with U8400.<br><br>- If you have 0v on pin 1 of R8442, the backlight circuit is not being told to turn on, which raises the possibility of a CPU issue, or an issue with the display cable/connector.<br>- Check the 5v inputs to U8400 PP5v_S0_BKLT_D<br><br>- PP5v_S0_LCDBKLT_D can be measured on R8444.<br><br>- Be sure to check voltage on both sides of the resistor. If voltage is lower on one side of the resistor, R8444 or R8445 is likely blown, probably due to a short within U8400.<br><br>-  If PP5v_S0_LCDBKLT_D is low (Substantially lower than 5v), replace U8400 AND R8444 as R8444 acts as a current limiting resistor to protect PP5v_G3S, and likely blew as a result of an internal short within U8400.<br><br>- **If you have low voltage on pin 2 of R8442 with normal voltage on pin 1 of R8842, replace U8400.**<br><br>- **If VIN, EN, and PP5v_S0_LCDBKLT_D are all present at normal levels, and you do not have backlight, replace U8400.**<br><br>- If EDP_BKLT_EN is missing, U8400 is **NOT** the cause of the issue. | [Source](https://repair.wiki/w/MacBook_Air_A1932_No_display_backlight_repair)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
