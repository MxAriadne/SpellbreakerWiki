| Not charging, no power.     |                                                                               | - If you have a tristar tester or lightning breakout board you should test that before attempting the following.<br><br>- Test with a known good battery.<br><br>- Replace charge port.<br><br>- If the above didn't help you likely have a dead tristar.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhkcc9CZeYU)                          |
| Intermittent display issue. | No backlight or no display at all.                                            | For whatever reason, the 5662 backlight IC dies over time and causes the intermittent no display issue and/or a total loss of display. Replacing this chip fixes the issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/A1893/A1954_2018_9.7%E2%80%9D_iPad_6th_Gen) |
| Touch issues.               | - May be ghost touching.<br><br>- Touch may randomly stop working during use. | - It's very easy to damage the digitizer FPC connector on the board. Inspect it for physical damage.<br><br>- Another common issue on this model is solder balls cracking under the touch ICs, usually reflowing them is enough to fix, if not then replace them.<br><br>- If the above does not fix the issue, it's likely some of the traces between the touch ICs and FPC connector are broken internally. There isn't a reliable fix for this. | [Source](https://old.repair.wiki/w/A1893/A1954_2018_9.7%E2%80%9D_iPad_6th_Gen) |
